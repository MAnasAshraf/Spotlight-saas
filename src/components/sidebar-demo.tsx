// This file is no longer needed as its functionality has been moved to:
// - src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx (for sidebar structure and logic)
// - src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (for the main dashboard content)
// Keeping it empty or deleting it is appropriate. For the purpose of this operation,
// we will empty its content. If your build system or linter complains about an empty .tsx file,
// you can add a simple placeholder export:
// export default function SidebarDemoPlaceholder() { return null; }
// However, for this automated change, we will just empty it.
// The file can be deleted manually if preferred.
